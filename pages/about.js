                <p>
                  Excel Glass, Inc. began its remarkable journey in August 1994, initially established under the name EXCELLINK ENTERPRISES. From its inception, the company has been dedicated to producing premium quality glass etched products, serving both individual and corporate markets.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  Our first major breakthrough came with our presence in SM Supupermalls, where our unique glass etching work gained widespread recognition and acceptance in the market. This early success set the foundation for our future growth and expansion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In August 1997, the company underwent a significant transformation under the management of Polly Alianan-Limpe's Family. This reorganization marked a new chapter in our history, bringing fresh perspectives and innovative approaches to our craft.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A pivotal moment came in January 2011 when the company welcomed new incorporators: Doreen M. Marquez, Jerry T. Limpe, Orceno M. Morada, Francisco C. Pascual, and Minda S. Trumata. Their combined expertise and vision have helped shape Excel Glass into the respected institution it is today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Throughout our journey, we've maintained a dedicated team of 15 employees, all specialists in their craft. Operating from our 240sqm factory and office space at Unit 4E Jolliland Townhomes 670 EDSA, Malibay City, we've consistently delivered excellence in glass etching services.
